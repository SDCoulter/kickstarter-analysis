# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is the GitHub upload for Module 1 of the UoT SCS Data Analytics course. It contains an Excel file with analysis performed on a set of data taken from Kickstarter. In this case we look at creating a report about the feasibility of getting funding for a play.

- I would not expect a theater kickstarter to be very successful above the ask of $5000 (and in GB any goal above Â£2000 is hughly unlikely to succeed). If you were to go ahead with one I would make sure you apply in May-June over any other month, and certainly avoid December-January.
